Tomorrow
- Create templates for Rio Hikes
- Create rules and description (people can advertise their tour guide products and people can do meetups with or without a guide. guides can't start a list)
- Create Rio Techies meetup message
- the big idea of the event is to create an environment for expats, foreigners, travelers and locals to exchange their experience with tech and get an understanding of the scenario in other countries. Especially for locals to learn from people that worked at the FA   ANG-level tech companies  
- Create Rio Marketplace Group
